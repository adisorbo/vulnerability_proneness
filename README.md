# Replication Package for the paper entitled “Exposed! On the Vulnerability-Proneness of Google Play Apps”

Description of the content:

1) the **data** folder contains the **dataset.csv** file in which all the data collected for the apps considered in the study are reported.    It is worth noticing that only cumulative information about vulnerabilities -- and not the specific vulnerabilities exhibited by            each app --  is reported, to prevent the dataset from being used for malicious purposes.

2) the **ml_experiments** folder contains the .arff files related to the ML experiments performed in our RQ3. As reported in the paper, in    each experiment we used a different combination of features and the 10-fold cross-validation strategy to train three machine learning      algorithms (i.e., Naive Bayes, J48 and Random Forest).
